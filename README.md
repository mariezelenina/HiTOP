# Abstract

This is the repostory for the code used for the manuscript "Test-Retest reliability and measurement invariance of a subset of the HiTOP internalizing scales with a two-week time window". 

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a novel way of measuring psychopathology, which addresses problems of existing measures.
The validated HiTOP scales have a 1-year assessment window. This poses a challenge for relating them to individual performance on cognitive tasks collected in a single day, 
as is common in research. We created a version of the scales more relevant for computational psychiatry by assessing symptoms over 2 weeks, using a subset of scales that were most relevant for depression and anxiety.
We confirmed that the scales measure the same underlying constructs as the original, 1-year scales, with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); analyzed their test-retest reliability with intracalss correlations (ICC), 
and tested their convergent and divergent validity against existing robust scales.

# How to run the code

All preprocessing and analyses were conducted in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks.

All code should be run in this order, cell by cell, changing paths as appropriate:

+ **NB_1_preprocess_and_descriptive.ipynb** preprocesses raw data and collects descriptive statistics.
+ **NB_2_cfa.ipynb** runs confirmatory factor analysis.
+ **NB_3_ICC.ipynb** runs test-retest reliability analysis.
+ **NB_4_convdiv.ipynb** tests convergent and divergent hypotheses.
+ ***NB_icc_plots.ipynb*** is used to produce Fig. 3 (ICC results).

If you come across an issue, please submit it in this repository or reach out to [Marie Zelenina](https://github.com/mariezelenina) or [Dylan Nielson](https://github.com/Shotgunosine) with questions.

# Where/how to get the data

TODO after data sharing.

## How to install dependencies

We use the following python libraries: 

*jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn (scikit-learn), scipy, itertools, openpyxl, contextlib, random, math, seaborn, datetime, csv, pingouin, statsmodels, pathlib, rpy2*

and the following R packages (for CFA analysis):

*lavaan, semTools, stringr, reticulate (+ base and utils)*

The CFA code uses a mix of python and R libraries, so it might get tricky. For integration between pythion and R, we used the version of rpy2=3.5.1, r-base=4.2.3. 

You can create a conda environment with:

`conda env create -p ./env -f environment_hitop.yml`

Loading R packages from the environment might cause errors. In that case, we recommend loading python packages from the provided environment and then installing R packages separately into the loaded environment.
